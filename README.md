# Bricks UI + Bootstrap

I love the [Bricks UI]("http://designmodo.com?u=94") framework but I suck at converting PSDs to actual code.

Hopefully this will help others use this awesome UI kit into their web apps right away.  It is using bootstrap.

# Demo
See the 3 example pages in the repo

Does anyone know how I can make these 3 pages render in github?  Can I add them to the gh-pages branch and have them render for a live demo?

# PSD Source
You will have to buy that directly from [Designmodo]("http://designmodo.com?u=94")

#Want To Help
This is NOT 100% done and is not perfect but it's a good start.  Go ahead and contribute if you can.

Thanks.
